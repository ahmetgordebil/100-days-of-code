# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 27 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: ES6 Practice, responsive web design certificate of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I need to get used to ES6 features. I aim to focus on ReactJS incoming months. I also need to practice media queries for better responsive design.
