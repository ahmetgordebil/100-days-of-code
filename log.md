# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 25 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the ES6 part of the freeCodeCamp. Worked on the snake game to practice.

**Thoughts** I think practicing a programming language through coding a game is the best way to understand certain mechanics. Many people recommend to start with frontend because of the visual feedback. With coding a basic game, this is at it peak.
