# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 25 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the ES6 part of the freeCodeCamp. Worked on the snake game to practice.

**Thoughts** I think practicing a programming language through coding a game is the best way to understand certain mechanics. Many people recommend to start with frontend because of the visual feedback. With coding a basic game, this is at it peak.

### Day 2: May 26 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the first challenge of freeCodeCamp's responsive web design projects. Fixed the broken part of snake game.

**Thoughts** Both of the things I've done today looks like I managed to complete something. I didn't. Website is far from being responsive and the game is lacking starting screen. Hope to do something tomorrow.

### Day 3: May 27 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed half of the basic data structures challenge of freeCodeCamp, also started to do something about second challenge of responsive web design.

**Thoughts** It was a long and tiring day. I didn't wanted to end the day without at least half hour of code. I will compensate tomorrow.

### Day 4: May 28 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the second challenge of freeCodeCamp's responsive web design projects and finished the design of third challenge (a landing page). I also coded something from book EloquentJS.

**Thoughts** Eloquent JS is a powerful source, but it prevents me to learn faster. Instead, I use it to polish things I've learned (to be honest, things that I believe I've learned). Currently working on redux, I will progress in fcc course tomorrow.
